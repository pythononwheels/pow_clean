##This is the new pow. And it's really good. (ok I might be biased ;)
But it's by far the best PoW (concept and implementation) ever !

###Principle
As simple to use as possible. Everything you always need on board. And you can always escape and go RAW.
Batteries included! (tornado Webswerver, SQLite DB)
###Strong Foundation:
* python 3.x
* tornado webserver
* sqlalchemy ORM
* cerberus schemas and validation on board
* react.js views
* tornado templates

###Super easy, quick to start and all the basics on board:
* super easy relations with decorators @relations.has_many("comments")
* super easy REST routing with decorators @app.add\_restful\_routes(), 
* routing decorator @app.add_route(route)
* db migrations autogenerated usin alembic in the back 
* validation on board with cerberus schemas
* automatic scaffolding views
* generate_models script
* generate_migrations script 
* update_db script
* generate_handlers 
* generate_app

## Current Status:
The current <master> version in this repo is fully working except for:
* automatic scaffolding views
